/*** DSA array in java **

   _ _Step1__: First we allocates the memory of an array in int or
    general I say (taking the size, no.of element that an array can hold, ex '5'),from the console window
    using scanner.nextInt() in a variable named ProductCount.

   __ Step2:__ Here, initializing an empty array name products which stores the string variable,
    and declared the variable size in it.(allocating space for it), 
    which we have been assign it before(ex size = 5)

    String[] product = new String[size]; 

   _ Step3_: To insert an element (products) in the array I use for loop.
    it begins with j = 0; iterating the element of an array at index = [0],[1],[2] so on..., then it will checked the     condition, 
    how many times to execute the block of statement in a loop
    assumed that j is less than 5 again, it will increment the value of j++ here how
    the loop will worked. 

  _ _ Step4__: After inserting element products in the arrary, it's time to read it on console using for loop
